	abstract = {The atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a software package written in the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations. In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.}

              accuracy of the uncertainty prediction can be benchmarked by
              maximum likelihood estimation, which can also be used to correct

               materials is challenging because it is inherently multi-scale:
               the bond-breaking processes that occur at the covalently bonded
               interface and initiate failure involve quantum mechanical
               phenomena, yet the mechanisms by which external stresses are

               offers qualitative insights missing from classical simulations.
               We use the hybrid approach to show how the chemical structure at

abstract = {Calculations of dislocation-defect interactions are essential to model metallic strength, but the required system sizes are at or beyond ab initio limits. Current estimates thus have extrapolation or finite size errors that are very challenging to quantify. Hybrid methods offer a solution, embedding small ab initio simulations in an empirical medium. However, current implementations can only match mild elastic deformations at the ab initio boundary. We describe a robust method to employ linear-in-descriptor machine learning potentials as a highly flexible embedding medium, precisely matching dislocation migration pathways whilst keeping at least the elastic properties constant. This advanced coupling allows dislocations to cross the ab initio boundary in fully three dimensional defect geometries. Investigating helium and vacancy segregation to edge and screw dislocations in tungsten, we find long-range relaxations qualitatively change impurity-induced core reconstructions compared to those in short periodic supercells, even when multiple helium atoms are present. We also show that helium-vacancy complexes, considered to be the dominant configuration at low temperatures, have only a very weak binding to screw dislocations. These results are discussed in the context of recent experimental and theoretical studies. More generally, our approach opens a vast range of mechanisms to ab initio investigation and provides new reference data to both validate and improve interatomic potentials.},

  abstract = {Adequate initial configurations for molecular dynamics simulations consist of arrangements of molecules distributed in space in such a way to approximately represent the system's overall structure. In order that the simulations are not disrupted by large van derWaals repulsive interactions, atoms from different molecules must keep safe pairwise distances. Obtaining such a molecular arrangement can be considered a packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the distance between atoms of different molecules must be greater than some specified tolerance. We have developed a code able to pack millions of atoms, grouped in arbitrarily complex molecules, inside a variety of three-dimensional regions. The regions may be intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or boxes. The user must provide only the structure of one molecule of each type and the geometrical constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy. Building complex mixtures, interfaces, solvating biomolecules in water, other solvents, or mixtures of solvents, is straightforward. In addition, different atoms belonging to the same molecule may also be restricted to different spatial regions, in such a way that more ordered molecular arrangements can be built, as micelles, lipid double-layers, etc. The packing time for state-of-the-art molecular dynamics systems varies from a few seconds to a few minutes in a personal computer. The input files are simple and currently compatible with PDB, Tinker, Molden, or Moldy coordinate files.

Contrary to previous studies on electrotunable lubrication that were carried out by fixing the charges, our simulations keep electrodes at fixed electrostatic potential using a variable charge method. For pure water and NaCl solutions, viscosity is independent of the polarization of the electrodes, but wall slip depends on the potential difference. Our findings are in agreement with previous analytical theories of how wall slip is affected by interatomic interactions. The simulations shed light on the role of electrode polarization for wall slip and illustrate a mechanism for controlling friction and nanoscale flow in simple aqueous lubricants.},

              concurrent multiscale technique that couples atomistic and
              discrete dislocation domains with the ability to pass
              dislocations seamlessly between domains. CADD has been
              demonstrated only in 2d plane-strain problems, for which each
              individual dislocation is either entirely atomistic or entirely
              discrete. Here, a full 3d implementation of CADD is presented,
              with emphasis on the algorithms for handling the description of
              dislocation lines that span both atomistic and continuum domains,
              so-called hybrid dislocations. The key new features of the method
              for 3d are (i) the use of an atomistic template of the
              dislocation core structure to transmit the proper atomistic
              environment of a continuum dislocation to the atomistic domain
              for hybrid dislocations and (ii) a staggered solution procedure
              enabling evolution of the hybrid dislocations. The method
              naturally requires calibration of discrete-dislocation Peierls
              stresses and mobilities to their atomistic values, implementation
              of a dislocation detection algorithm to identify atomistic
              dislocations, and computation of continuum dislocation
              displacement fields that provide boundary conditions for the
              atomistic problem. The method is implemented using the atomistic
              code LAMMPS and the discrete dislocation code ParaDiS within the
              LibMultiscale environment developed by the lead authors, and so
              has all the advantages of these widely-used high-performance
              open-source codes. Validation and application of CADD-3d are

               application is the effective simulation of many-atom systems.
               Here, we review empirical interatomic potentials designed to
               reproduce elastic properties, defect energies, bond breaking,
               bond formation, and even redox reactions. We discuss popular
               two-body potentials, embedded-atom models for metals, bond-order
               potentials for covalently bonded systems, polarizable potentials
               including charge-transfer approaches for ionic systems and
               quantum-Drude oscillator models mimicking higher-order and
               many-body dispersion. Particular emphasis is laid on the
               question what constraints ensue from the functional form of a
               potential, e.g., in what way Cauchy relations for elastic tensor
               elements can be violated and what this entails for the ratio of
               defect and cohesive energies, or why the ratio of boiling to
               melting temperature tends to be large for potentials describing
               metals but small for short-ranged pair potentials. The review is
               meant to be pedagogical rather than encyclopedic. This is why we

              simulations of a sliding spherical asperity reveal the following
              two friction regimes: at low loads, the films show Amonton's
              friction with a friction force that rises linearly with normal
              load, and at high loads, the friction force is independent of the
              load as long as no direct solid-solid contact occurs. The
              transition between these two regimes happens when a single
              molecular layer is confined in the gap between the sliding
              bodies. The friction force at high loads on a monolayer rises
              monotonically with film density and drops slightly with the

              calculations, and visualization, in the areas of computational
              physics and chemistry. The program can run on GNU/Linux, Apple
              Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows platforms. Many file formats are
              supported, allowing for easy conversion of atomic configuration
              files. The command-line options allow to construct supercells,
              insert point defects (vacancies, interstitials), line defects
              (dislocations, cracks), plane defects (stacking faults), as well
              as other transformations. Several options can be applied
              consecutively, allowing for a comprehensive workflow from a unit
              cell to the final atomic system. Some modes allow to construct

              It supports many lattice types, all atom chemical species, and
              supports systems described with the ionic core--shell model. It
              allows to construct dislocations and analyze them, and perform
              post-treatment of simulation output files. Restrictions: no
              support for molecular bonds; limit of 2 billions particles.
              Unusual features: dislocations in anisotropic media; computation
              of the Nye tensor; generation of polycrystal from any type of
              lattice; support for ionic core--shell models and analysis of
